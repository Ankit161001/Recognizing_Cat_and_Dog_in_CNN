# Recognizing_Cat_and_Dog_in_CNN
It is a python code to build a CNN model and to train the model to differentiate between cat and dog images.
<br>
Feel free to use two test images of a puppy and a cat, `puppy21.jpg` and `cat21.jpg` respectively.

### Code Description
Before executing the python notebook be sure to install keras and numpy. For installing first check if you have python installed.
Head over to `python.org` to install python. When installed run command prompt. Execute the command `pip install keras` and then `pip install numpy`.
These codes will successfully install keras and numpy modules in your system.
<br>
<br>
The python notebook is commented in each block to make it easier to understand.
<p>
The code Follows the following approach::
<br>
  1) Initialising the CNN
  2) Step 1 - Convolution <br>
  3) Step 2 - Pooling <br>
  4) Step 3 - Flattening <br>
  5) Step 4 - Full connection <br>
  6) Compiling the CNN <br>
  7) Training the model <br>
  8) predictions for dog image using train model <br>
  9) predictions for cat image using train model <br>
